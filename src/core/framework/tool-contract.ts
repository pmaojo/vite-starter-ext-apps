/**
 * @file Tool Contract & Micro-Manifest Architecture Definitions
 *
 * @description
 * This file defines the core types that drive the application's "Micro-Manifest Architecture".
 * Instead of a monolithic application where the core router imports deeply nested components
 * and logic, each feature (tool) is self-contained. Tools expose a `ToolManifest` which is
 * then collected by a central registry (`src/tools/registry.ts`).
 *
 * This design enforces loose coupling, makes adding new tools purely additive, and ensures
 * that metadata required for routing and configuration is colocated with the tool's source code.

/**
 * The unified descriptor for a self-contained MCP Tool integration.
 *
 * @description
 * Every tool module must export an object conforming to this interface.
 * The registry uses this metadata to map the `toolName` provided by the host context
 * to the corresponding React component.
 *
 * @property {string} slug - Unique identifier for the tool. **Must strictly match the tool name**
 *                           registered on the server-side via `registerAppTool` (e.g., `"get-time"`).
 * @property {React.ComponentType<ToolComponentProps>} component - The UI root component for the tool.
 *                           Note: Standard static imports are preferred over `React.lazy()`
 *                           in the registry to preserve strong type-checking and immediate availability.
